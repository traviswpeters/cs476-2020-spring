## Grades

I am always happy to answer questions, but I don't pre-grade assignments.

I do not curve grades. The score you earn is the score you receive.

## Submitting Work

Submit assignments in D2L.

Submit all assignments via the course D2L site by 11:59:00 p.m. on the due date.

You can submit an assignment an unlimited number of times. Graders will only grade your final submission.

## Communication

Use [Slack](https://slack.com) for all course communication.
> **Why?**
> Most students will not use a proper learning management system (LMS) such as Brightspace/D2L, Blackboard, or Canvas after they receive their diplomas.
> On the other hand, students will almost certainly use a new collaboration tool at some point in their careers.
> Why not introduce one of the most powerful and popular ones while they are still in school?

Please do not send me messages via D2L.
Please do not use e-mail *unless you absolutely have to*.

I typically donâ€™t respond to emails or Slack direct messages (DMs) past 8 p.m.
Generally speaking, I will not respond on weekends and certainly not immediately.
Please do not expect an instant answer if you send me an email or DM in Slack.
I sometimes go off the grid to focus---something that [a great deal of research suggests](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202) you do too.

## Getting help

You are always welcome to come to my office hours as often as you like.
Note, though, that I won't merely provide answers to assignments.
I believe in the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) and often [answer students' questions with questions](https://www.philsimon.com/blog/higher-education/analytics-students/).
