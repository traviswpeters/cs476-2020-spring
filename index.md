## About the Course

This course introduces students to introductory topics in computer and network security.

Students will study a variety of attacks on computer software and hardware.
These attacks are caused by the vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of computer systems.
The course emphasizes "learning by doing," and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises.
Through these labs, students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to apply those principles to solve real problems.
