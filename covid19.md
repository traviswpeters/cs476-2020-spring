##  Spring 2020 Course Updates & COVID-19 Response _(NEW!)_
{:.titletext}
Re: Moving to Remote Learning in response to COVID-19
{:.subtitletext}

As you may have heard, starting on 3/23 (the Monday after "Spring" Break),
MSU will be transitioning to online delivery of courses in order to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus (a.k.a., Coronavirus).
For CSCI 476, the big change is that we won't be meeting in person anymore &#128532;.
Instead, I will record a series of videos each week and post them to our course website (here!).
I'll also hold office hours virtually, instead of in-person office hours.
Other than that, not too much will change _(hopefully...)_.

#### Course Updates:
- I will hold virtual office hours in my "Personal Room" on [**_WebEx_**](https://montana.webex.com/meet/w52k448).
  - _Currently I plan to be on Webex during my regular office hours: **Tuesday/Thursday 4:30 pm â€“ 6:00 pm**._
- You can use my [**_Calendly_**](https://calendly.com/traviswpeters) link to schedule an alternative meeting time if you can't meet during office hours.
  - _Preferably, start with a 15 minute slot; we can use more time if needed._
- I will continue to update the [**_Schedule_**](https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476/#schedule) as I have been all semester.
  - _In lieu of in-class lectures, I will post a series of recorded mini-lectures to the appropriate week/day so you can watch them at your convenience._
- I will continue to update the [**_Labs_**](https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476/labs) page as I have been all semester.
  - _Since all of our labs are done on a VM that runs atop a personal machine, we should be able to proceed with labs as usual._
    _Please contact me **ASAP** if this is not the case for you._
- We will continue to use [**_Slack_**](https://csci476-sp2020.slack.com) for discussions and questions about lectures, labs, and so forth.
  - _I will make email announcements via our course mailing list on rare occasion if I need to get news out quickly to all._

#### MSU Updates:
- The [_**MSU Bookstore has resources available to faculty and students**_]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid19/msu_bookstore_covid19.pdf)
  during the transition to online this semester and for summer online courses.
- MSU is maintaining a helpful page for students: [**_Students: Learn Anywhere_**](http://ato.montana.edu/learnanywhere/students/index-old.html)
- The [_**GSoC Student Success Center**_](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html) is still operating (virtually).
- The [_**last day to drop a class is April 14th**_](http://www.montana.edu/registrar/drop.html).
- You can [_**request to have your final grade be pass/fail**_](https://www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus/archived-comms.html#email24) as opposed to a letter grade by [_**filling out a form**_]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid19/grade_change_form.pdf) and submitting to the Registrar's office. 

#### Expectations for Instructor:
I understand that this may be a difficult transition for you, but I will do my best to maintain consistent communication with you,
including updating you on any and all course changes or upcoming assignments to keep you on track.
I will keep the schedule (below) updated with relevant links, readings, and so forth.
Please bear with me as I am learning how to conduct our course remotely
(e.g., recording and posting mini-lectures, organizing virtual office hours, etc.).

#### Expectations for Students:
Although you may be new to online learning, it requires that you be more disciplined in completing the work at your own time and pace.
Please make sure to check this website and our course Slack workspace regularly.
I don't foresee this class taking more time when it is all said and done.
It is increasingly important for you, however, to communicate with me if you are getting hung up on anything.
I've posted a few ways that we can meet (e.g., my scheduled virtual office hours, using Calendly to schedule 1-on-1 time together) --- please utilize these opportunities!
