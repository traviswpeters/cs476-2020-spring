{:.mt-3}

Are you presenting at NCUR?
If you are, you can earn extra credit in this course!

**Your task** is to write a 1-2 page reflection paper about your work and your experience as a presenter.

Include in your paper:
- The title of your presentation and the names of other collaborators.
- Why you selected this topic to research (i.e., what is the motivation for your work?).
- What you find most interesting about this work.
- What (if any) connections can you make between this presentation and a topic (or topics) in our course?
- What aspects of your presentation at NCUR went well?  This can include items such as "spoke clearly, concise, polished, enthusiastic" and so forth.
- What aspects of your presentation do you think could be improved upon?  
- What was the most challenging thing about presenting at a conference like NCUR? How did your prepare for this challenge? What would you do differently if you had the opportunity to present at a conference again?

### Option 2 - Attendee Reflection

<!-- Motivated by https://guides.lib.montana.edu/c.php?g=915151&p=6594096 -->

Not presenting at NCUR?
That's OK! You can still earn extra credit in this course!

**Your task** is to attend (at least) one session at the NCUR conference and write a 1-2 page reflection paper.
The session should be one you think you might be interested in and does not need to be related to this course (though it would be awesome if it were).
Even if the topic is not directly related to our course, there can be value in learning about topics that you are less familiar with.

Include in your paper:
- The title of the presentation and the speaker's name.
- Why you decided to attend the session.
- Why the presenter said they selected this topic to research (i.e., what is the motivation for their work?).
- What you found most interesting about the presentation.
- What (if any) connections can you make between this presentation and a topic (or topics) in our course?
- What do you think the presenter did well?  This can include items such as "spoke clearly, concise, polished, enthusiastic" and so forth.
- What do you think the presenter could improve upon?  
- What you think would be the most challenging thing about presenting at a conference? How could a person prepare for this challenge?   
<!-- - In thinking about the potential of you making a presentation, how do you think practicing would play a part of an effective presentation? -->
