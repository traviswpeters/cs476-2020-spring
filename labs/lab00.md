- **Virtual Machine Software:**
  Install [VirtualBox 6.0.4]. _Please stay away from the newer versions, because they have some issues with the SEED Labs VM._
- **Ubuntu 16.04 Virtual Machine Image:**
  Download the pre-built Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine image.
  All the Linux labs use this image.
  To use this image, do the following:
  - Download the [SEEDUbuntu16.04 virtual machine image].
  - Unzip it, and you should be able to see a folder.
  - Follow the [SEED Labs User Manual] to run the VM on VirtualBox.

_**Note:**
For the lab setup, you do not need to submit anything.
However, we strongly urge you to get the environment set up as soon as possible, and start getting familiar with the environment.
For those who are not familiar with the Linux operating system, you may need to spend some extra time._
