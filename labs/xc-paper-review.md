Due to the unfortunate cancellation of NCUR, I am offering a new extra credit option.

**Your Task:**
Find a recent/interesting research paper and write a 1-2 page (single-spaced) review of the paper.

If you don't know where to start, I suggest skimming the websites/"programs" for conferences from recent years.
You could try:
[WiSec (Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks)](https://wisec2020.ins.jku.at) /
[CCS (Computer and Communications Security)](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/) /
[USENIX Security](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20) /
[NDSS (Network and Distributed System Security)](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2020/) /
[Crypto](https://crypto.iacr.org/2020/) /
[RAID (Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses)](https://www.raid-2019.org) /
[IEEE SecDev (Secure Systems)](https://secdev.ieee.org/2020/Home) /
[PETS (Privacy Enhancing Technologies)](https://petsymposium.org).

**Your review should include:**
- The title of the paper and when/where it was published.
- Why you selected this paper.
- A brief summary of the paper (include claimed contributions).
- What you find most interesting about the work presented in the paper.
- What (if any) connections can you make between this presentation and a topic (or topics) in our course?
- What were strengths of the paper?
- What aspects of the paper do you think could be improved upon?
