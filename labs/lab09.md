{:.subtitletext}

### Overview

The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key encryption.
After finishing the lab, students should be able to gain a first-hand experience on encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV).
Moreover, students will be able to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages.

### Details
